                We didn't care about profits. Our only goal was to create a new education system for all even the graduates. People don't know what they like until and unless they do anything. The system fulfills that and open to a wide range of subjects but the problem arrises when they force the kids to learn the things other than what they are actually curious about. And coming to the graduates, they know what they know and can share their knowledge whether advanced or not and that can be used to educate the poor ones who just have phones nad access to internet.

                The education system is changing and obviously we don't want radical change. We always want gradual change where people don't actually realize how much change there has been at the end. It is like seeeing 20 years back when we said "God, I have access to all the information in the world in just a fraction of seconds!"

            So, the root of all problems in the current system is that it is majorly derived of the old principles of which our parents used to study and not the actual principles which the current generation work. Gaining knowledge and education should be enjoyable and that's what the system is not much focused upon. Mostly is it focused upon the whole 'information memorizing' thing rather than passing that information in a rather enjoyable manner.

            Let's give an insight over this. The current generation is more technology oriented way like phones, computers and internet etc. And we are handing them piles of books rather than making the devices which they are using a source of passing the same information in the books in a more friendly and interactive way. That's where the whole world is lacking not just any particular country.
