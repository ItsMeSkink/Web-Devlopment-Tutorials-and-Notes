    <!-- ID attribute is used as a defination variable for the whole element under the tag it is used under. The ID (variable) designated for the tag can be used in CSS to style/customize it. Each tag has to have a different/unique ID -->
    <!-- Class is used to customize/style different tags/elements at once instead of customizing it using the ID tag. -->
    <!-- ID = Species of the tag,
     Class = Genus of the tag -->
    <!-- There can be multiple CLASSES for  1 Tag. To write more classes than 1 just put a space after the current class and write the next class you want the tag to follow. The tag/element will follow all the classes it has been designated to. E.g. In this case, both the Red Background and the Yellow Font Colour -->
