    <h1>Semantic Tags</h1>

    <h3>Semantic Elements</h3>
    <!-- Semantic Elements are used to give meaning to other tags and help the WebSite rank better -->
    <!-- e.g. -->
    <details>
        This is an example of &lt;details&gt; tag!
    </details>
    <!-- here the <detail> tag is used in website to cover less space. In this the user would click the details button and then a piece of text written by the coder under it would pop down -->

    <details>
        <summary>
            Click here to access more information
        </summary>
        There are no strings on me
    </details>
    <!-- here the summary tag under the details tag it to replace the "Details" text on the WebPage and customize it according to the coder. Outside the summary tag, inside the details tag is the text that would be displayed after the text under summary would be clicked -->
    <!-- The Semantic Tags are only used with CSS customization. -->
