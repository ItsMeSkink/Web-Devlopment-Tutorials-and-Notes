// npm = NODE PACKAGE MANAGER
// this is to manage all the modules, dependencies etc. as a whole

// npm init -> is used to create a package.json file which will store and manage all the dependencies and display it. 

// npm install _dependecy_ -> to install something

// npm uninstall _dependency_ -> to uninstall something

// to install the package globally, we use -> npm install _package_ --global

// to install the package that will be used only during production, we use              -> npm install _package_ --save-dev


// -> npm install _dependencies_@0.0.0  |  0.0.0 is version which we want to install. 

//  the versions are like this major.minor.patch | the 1 is major version here, 4 is the minor version and 6 is the patch. This keeps updating regularly

// the patch is updated after someone identifies a bug and the creator of the package/module modifies it. So if the bug was in x.x.1, it will change to x.x.2 after it has been resolved. 

// if you want to make a new version of the module/package that serves the same function as before along with some new and updated functions. So if the old version was x.1.x, it will become x.2.0 after we roll out a new version of the package/module. THIS IS IN THE CASE OF MINOR CHANGES AND ADDITIONS

// if major changes have been made which includes removal of some previous functions and addition of majro one. It would be counted as major version update. old version 1.x.x, then new would be 2.0.0.
