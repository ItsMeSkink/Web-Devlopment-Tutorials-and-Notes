        <span id="para" class="pa">
        There are three types of CSS implementation:
    </span>

        <ol>
            <li style="font-style: italic; color: red; background-color:royalblue; ">
                This is INLINE CSS. It refers to the Style Customization within the text syntax.
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>This is Internal CSS. This refers to the style customization within the document by putting the &lt;style&gt; tag within the head tag. It is outside the text tag.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    This is External CSS. This means that the Style customization is done outside the HTML document with the help of an additional linked file with .css extension. If 2 or more customizations are overrding each other then the text will follow the precedence.
                    Means the one that is written after the first customization, the text will follow that. Bu tot make that an exception, put "!important" under the text tag
                </div>
                <li></li>
        </ol>
    </body>
