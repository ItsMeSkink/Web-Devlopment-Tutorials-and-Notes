// here after the function tag, we can define anything a function. Ater the function name, we have to put the (variable_name_the_function_is_put_for) which in this case is Subject1.
// Inside the curly brackets, there would be the action for the funciton which in this case is console.log("My favourite subject is " + Subject1). 
// function ___functionvariable___ (Variable) {  action  }
// once a variable is defined in the brackets, it is connected to the same one inside the curly brackets which means that it has to be also mentioned in the called function


// d variable is being outputted here. and further action in the curly brackets are not executed

// this is used to prevent repeatations of multiple actions
// multiple variable function can also be called in for once seperated by a comma.

// instead of doing this, we can include a function that can shorten this
