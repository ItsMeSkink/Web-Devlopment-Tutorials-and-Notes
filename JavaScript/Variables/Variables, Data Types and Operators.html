            //this will display -> --37 <- This is an example of an uniary negation operator.


            var a = 4;
            a = a + 6;
            // this is an example of binary operator.  
            console.log(a);
            // this will display -> 10 <-.

            // operators not only work on numeric value but also on strings in a specific way. 

            num1 = 30;
            num2 = 70;

            console.log("The increment after num1 is " + (num1++))
            // this means tha same value would be printed but the increment will occur after the print
            console.log("The increment before num1 is " + (++num1))
            // this means that the increased valu would be printed after adding 1 in the number But in the previous statement the value of num1 already increases after printing. So, in the current statment, 30+1+1 would be printed which results to 32.  
            console.log("The decrement after num2 is " + (num2--))
            // this is inverse of the after increment statement. In this the same value would be printed first and then the number would be decreased
            console.log("The decrement before num2 is " + (--num2))
            // this is inverse of the before increment statement. In this the decreased value would be printed. In the previous statement the value of num1 is already decreased and in the current it also decreases, It would go like 70-1-1.








            // OPERATORS IN JAVASCRIPT

            // Let's take an example to understand what is an operators. 3 + 7 -> ' + '' is operator and 3 and 7 are operands
            // OPERANDS IN JAVASCRIPT

            // They are enetities on which operators operate 

            // There are 2 types of operators which are-> 

            // 1) Uniary Operator -> x = -x (It represents the uniary negation operator)
            // Works on only a single operand  

            // 2) Binary Operator ->
