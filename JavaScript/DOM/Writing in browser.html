        // Write your JavaScript here! 
        // You can write even in the document after putting the script tag and even in an external document after linking the front-end document
        // It is recomendded to put the JavaScript to put after the whole front-end content to prevent any kind of lagging in the page. 
        // Lets take an example for a function
        console.log ('Hello World')
        // this wil display the text in the Console Section and not the element section
        // The console section is to identify the live errors in the webpage and also used to confirm the function if they are working properly. 
        // if there is an error in the javascript document, it would be identified in the console section and it could be figured out by clicking the hyperlinked text on the right. It would guide you to the line or error and it can be fixed in the document.
