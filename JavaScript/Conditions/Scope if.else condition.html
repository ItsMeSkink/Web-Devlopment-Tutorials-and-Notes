In this case first, the string1 is defined as "THis is a string." and then as "This is an example of a string.". If we print it in the console log on anywhere, the text that would be considered and displayed would be the latest one that is defined. In this case, it is "THis is an example of a string". IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE PRECEDENCE OF THE DEFINATION OF THE VARIABLES.

If tried, error will pop up. "let" is a function. SCOPE IS THE EFFECT OF TEH DECLERATION/DEFINATION OF TEH VARIABLE ON OTHER or THE ACCESSIBILTY OF THE VARIABLES ON THE WHOLE CODE. 
            // In this case, the effect of the variable will only be limited to its origin of defination only. Let's understand it properly. Even though "let" is a global variable, it will affect the whole code. if declared again-> error. But if it is declared in a curly brackets, no error will be displayed, because it doesn't coem under global effects of the decleration on the variable
